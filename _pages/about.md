I am currently a second-year master's student majoring in Software Engineering at the [School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cst.zju.edu.cn/). I am affiliated with the ACES-HiG laboratory, where I am advised by [Dr. Bo Lin](). 


My research primarily focuses on the early detection and rehabilitation of chronic disease, including but not limited to the study and practical application of computer vision[(CV)](), large language model[(LLM)]() and human-computer interaction[(HCI)]() technology.




Previously, I earned my B.A. degree in Software Engineering with Honors from Zhejiang University of Technology(ZJUT).
